title: Pseudo-Random vs. Random Numbers in R
url: /2011/11/25/pseudo-random-vs-random-numbers-in-r/
---

Earlier, I found [an interesting post from Bo Allen](http://www.boallen.com/random-numbers.html) on [pseudo-random](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) vs [random numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number), where the author uses a simple bitmap ([heat map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map)) to show that the __rand__ function in [PHP](http://www.php.net/) has a systematic pattern and compares these to __truly random__ numbers obtained from [random.org](http://www.random.org/). The post's results suggest that pseudo-randomness in [PHP](http://www.php.net/) is faulty and, in general, should not be underestimated in practice. Of course, the findings should not be too surprising, as there is a large body of literature on the subtleties, philosophies, and implications of the __pseudo__ aspect of the most common approaches to random number generation. However, it is silly that [PHP](http://www.php.net/)'s [random number generator (RNG)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) displays such an obvious pattern nowadays because there are several decent, well-studied pseudo-RNG algorithms available as well as numerous tests for randomness.  For a good introduction to [RNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation), I recommend [John D. Cook's discussion on testing a random number generator](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/12/06/how-to-test-a-random-number-generator-2/).

Now, I would never use [PHP](http://www.php.net/) for any (serious) statistical analysis, partly due to my fondness for [R](http://www.r-project.org/), nor do I doubt the practicality of the [RNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) in [R](http://www.r-project.org/). But I was curious to see what would happen. So, created equivalent plots in [R](http://www.r-project.org/) to see if a __rand__ equivalent would exhibit a systematic pattern like in [PHP](http://www.php.net/), even if less severe. Also, for comparison, I chose to use [the __random__ package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/random/index.html), from [Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/), to draw __truly random__ numbers from [random.org](http://www.random.org/). Until today, I had only heard of [the __random__ package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/random/index.html) but had never used it.

I have provided the function __rand_bit_matrix__, which requires the number of rows and columns to display in the plotted bitmap. To create the bitmaps, I used [the __pixmap__ package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pixmap/index.html) rather than [the much-loved __ggplot2__ package](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/), simply because of how easy it was for me to create the plots. (If you are concerned that I have lost the faith, please note that I am aware of the awesomeness of [__ggplot2__](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) and [its ability](http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/06/05/conways-game-of-life-in-r-with-ggplot2-and-animation/) [to create heat maps](http://learnr.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ggplot2-quick-heatmap-plotting/).)

It is important to note that there were two challenges that I encountered when using drawing __truly random numbers__.

1. Only 10,000 numbers can be drawn at once from [random.org](http://www.random.org/). (This is denoted as __max_n_random.org__ in the function below.)
2. There is a daily limit to the number of times the [random.org](http://www.random.org/) service will provide numbers.

To overcome the first challenge, I split the total number of bits into separate calls, if necessary. This approach, however, increases our number of requests, and after too many requests, you will see the error: __random.org suggests to wait until tomorrow__. Currently, I do not know the exact number of allowed requests or if the amount of requested random numbers is a factor, but looking back, I would guess about 20ish large requests is too much.

Below, I have plotted 500 x 500 bitmaps based on the _random_ bits from both of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [random.org](http://www.random.org/). As far as I can tell, no apparent patterns are visible in either plot, but from the graphics alone, our conclusions are limited to ruling out obvious systematic patterns, which were exhibited from the [PHP](http://www.php.net/) code. I am unsure if the [PHP](http://www.php.net/) folks formally tested their [RNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) algorithms for __randomness__, but even if they did, the code in both [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [PHP](http://www.php.net/) is straightforward and provides a quick eyeball test. Armed with similar plots alone, the [PHP](http://www.php.net/) devs could have sought for better [RNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) algorithms â€” perhaps, borrowed those from [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
