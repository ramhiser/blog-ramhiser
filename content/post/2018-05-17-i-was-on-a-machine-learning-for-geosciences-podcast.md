I listen to a lot of podcasts — [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/), [EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/), [Rocket](https://www.relay.fm/rocket), [Talking Machines](https://www.thetalkingmachines.com/). But I had an opportunity to be on one called [Undersampled Radio](https://undersampledrad.io/)! It was a lot of fun.

The hosts, [Gram Ganssle and Matt Hall](https://undersampledrad.io/about-us/), were very accommodating and asked great questions. Much of the conversation was about the future of machine learning in oil and gas and how [Novi Labs](http://novilabs.com/), the startup I work for, is a major part of it.

Topics:

* Intro
* [Austin Deep Learning](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Deep-Learning/)
* Overview of Novi Labs
* Predicting Oil and Gas Production
* Do we need experts?
* AI vs Physics Models
* [Karpatne paper: Machine Learning for the Geosciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04708)
* Answer scientific questions with machine learning
* What to study in school for machine learning
* Puzzle
* What we’re currently reading 

Finally, Undersampled Radio recorded the conversation via Google Hangouts and posted the video on YouTube:
