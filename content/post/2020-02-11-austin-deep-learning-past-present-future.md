Last month we began the new year looking at how far the [Austin Deep Learning meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Deep-Learning/) has come. What started as a Sunday afternoon hack session has turned into a large community of data scientists, researchers, and hobbyists. Now at nearly 2,600 members, we have a thriving group, an active Slack channel, two amazing sponsors ([KungFu.ai](http://www.kungfu.ai/) and [Capital Factory](https://capitalfactory.com/)) and a wonderful [journal club](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Deep-Learning/events/268479513/) that meets 2 times per month (3 times soon?).

## Member Feedback


At the [last meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Deep-Learning/events/267517968/) (video above, [slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSb_eENd-J15YvVtr_26CSKFJhl0ZoWezLe8PAknXok/edit?usp=sharing)), I spoke about the meetup's journey, its growth, and sought feedback about topics of interest and possible alternatives to the meetup's one-talk-per-month format. The discussions and suggestions were fantastic, but my favorites were "How to Do an AI Startup", talks from UT professors ([example](https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-AI/events/jgnwbpyzhbnc/)), lightning talks, and hackathons. Volunteers to help see these ideas happen would be wonderful.

Thanks to everyone for all the great suggestions. Here are a number of ideas the group came up with:

### Topics of Interest

- How to Do an AI Startup
- "Things I Built"
- Bert
- Deployment Frameworks (Kubeflow)
- Chatbots
- Recommendation Engines
- Bayesian Neural Nets / Probabilistic Programming
- Talks from UT professors
- Build vs Rent Hardware
- More computer vision (it's been a while)
- More NLP

### Meetup Suggestions

- Lightning talks
- Workshops aimed at beginners
- Tutorials 3x per year
- Joint Meetups where interests intersect (e.g., ML Robotics)
- Best of Journal Club
