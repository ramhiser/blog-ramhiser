Occasionally, I will query Google with “statistics conferences”, “machine learning conferences” or “pattern recognition conferences” and the like. But often, it is difficult to obtain anything
meaningful other than the conferences of which I'm already aware (such as JSM, ICML, some IEEE conferences). Today, I found [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/), which is a __A Wiki for Calls for
Papers__. This seems to be what I needed. In particular, the following are very useful to me:

* [Machine Learning on WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=machine%20learning)
* [Statistics on WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=statistics)

It seems limited for statistics though, as JSM is not even listed.
